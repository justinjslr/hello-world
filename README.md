# hello-world

This is the result of following one of GitHub Guides, [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## First step in GitHub

I'd like to share my activities through this GitHub site.
It's well formed and supported.
I'll keep this hello-world project to the last moments.

## What should I do next?

At first, I should be familiar with this markdown syntax.
[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a good reference.
It offers even [download PDF version](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).
This will be your quick reference sheet.
- [ ] Is there any quick reference card?
