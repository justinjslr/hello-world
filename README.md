# hello-world

This is a result of following GitHub Guides, [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## First step in GitHub

I'd like to share my activities through this GitHub site.
Since it is well formed and supported, I'll keep this page to the last moments.

## What should I do next?

### GitHub Markdown

At first, I should be familiar with markdown syntax to write something.<br>
[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a good reference.
It offers even downloadable [PDF version](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).
This will be your quick reference sheet.

### GitHub Training & Guides

There is [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides) for GitHub training and guides.
It is worthy of watching!

## Writing Journal in GitHub

### GitHub Pages

I can make my simple websites using by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
These are my first websites in public area.

- User site: [justinjslr](https://justinjslr.github.io/), For writing journals about my activities.
- Project site: [hello-world](https://justinjslr.github.io/hello-world/)

I've setup my basic [User](https://justinjslr.github.io/) and [Project](https://justinjslr.github.io/hello-world/) site.
Since GitHub Pages are powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/), I'll improve them by following [Blogging with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) guide.

### GitHub Gist

There is a place to share code, notes and snippets instantly. [**GitHub**Gist](https://gist.github.com/)

### Wiki in GitHub repository

Each repository can have wiki page to lay out the roadmap of the project, show the current status, and document software better, together.
